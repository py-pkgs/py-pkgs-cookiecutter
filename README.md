`py-pkgs-cookiecutter` is a [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) template for creating a fully-featured Python package using [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org). It supplements the [Python Packages book](https://py-pkgs.org) by Tomas Beuzen and Tiffany Timbers but can be used independently.

1. Install [`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Generate a Python package structure using [`py-pkgs-cookiecutter`](https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter):

    ```bash
    cookiecutter https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter.git
